My name is Patrick Raedler and I am self-taught Software Engineer.

Currently working at [cubemos](https://cubemos.com/).

Administrator and contributor of [Schr√∂dinger Hat](https://www.schrodinger-hat.it).

Contributing and participating in the open source community is one of the things I enjoy the most. Besides that I really like to work on my personal projects with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). Don't hesitate to ping me if you want to chat about the topics above!

Besides from coding, my favorite hobbies are: reading fantasy books (especially the ones from [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)), cooking and learning recipes, playing my electric bass and DM games of Dungeons & Dragons!
